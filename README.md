Files for "The Labor Market Effects of Immigration Enforcement"

Updated 5.13.22 by Chloe N. East

The do and R files to replicate East et al. (2022) are included in the Code folder. The numbers on each file indicate the order in which they should be run. The top of each do file notes the Figures and Tables that will be created in the file.

The Data folder includes several files to be used for replication. 

"287g_SC_EVerify_1_31_22_cpuma0010" is the enforcement data set we use that contains information about SC, 287(g) agreements and E-Verify. 

See the paper for more details and sources.
